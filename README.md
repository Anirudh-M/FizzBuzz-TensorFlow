# FizzBuzz-TensorFlow

<p>FizzBuzz implementation with machine learning using TensorFlow</p>

<p>The notebook file contains the implementation of FizzBuzz program in two ways.</p>

<p>The first method is a simple function which tests whether a number is a multiple of 3, 5 or 15 or not and prints out the corresponding output.</p>

<p>The second method involves training a machine learning model from the numbers 101 to 1000. To train the model, a CSV file is created with the numbers and its corresponding output. Once the model is trained, the model is provided with the CSV file containing just the numbers from 1 to 100. The outputs are then checked for accuracy by comparing the results obtained from the simple function.</p>
